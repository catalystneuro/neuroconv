SpikeGLX & Phy
--------------

A common workflow is to record electrophysiology data and then extract spiking units. The following is an example of
how to combine electrophysiology recordings and spike sorting data in the same conversion. For this specific example
were are combining a SpikeGLX recording with Phy sorting results using the
:py:class:`~neuroconv.datainterfaces.ecephys.spikeglx.spikeglxdatainterface.SpikeGLXRecordingInterface` and
:py:class:`~.neuroconv.datainterfaces.ecephys.phy.phydatainterface.PhySortingInterface` classes.
