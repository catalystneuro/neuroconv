DeepLabCut data conversion
--------------------------

Install NeuroConv with the additional dependencies necessary for reading DeepLabCut data.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install "neuroconv[deeplabcut]"

Convert DeepLabCut pose estimation data to NWB using :py:class:`~neuroconv.datainterfaces.behavior.deeplabcut.deeplabcutdatainterface.DeepLabCutInterface`.
This interface supports both .h5 and .csv output files from DeepLabCut.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo
    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>> from neuroconv.datainterfaces import DeepLabCutInterface

    >>> file_path = BEHAVIOR_DATA_PATH / "DLC" / "open_field_without_video" / "m3v1mp4DLC_resnet50_openfieldAug20shuffle1_30000.h5"
    >>> config_file_path = BEHAVIOR_DATA_PATH / "DLC" / "open_field_without_video" / "config.yaml"

    >>> interface = DeepLabCutInterface(file_path=file_path, config_file_path=config_file_path, subject_name="ind1", sampling_frequency=30.0, verbose=False)

    >>> metadata = interface.get_metadata()
    >>> # For data provenance we add the time zone information to the conversion
    >>> session_start_time = datetime(2020, 1, 1, 12, 30, 0, tzinfo=ZoneInfo("US/Pacific"))
    >>> metadata["NWBFile"].update(session_start_time=session_start_time)
    >>> # Add subject information (required for DANDI upload)
    >>> metadata["Subject"] = dict(subject_id="subject1", species="Mus musculus", sex="M", age="P30D")
    >>> # Choose a path for saving the nwb file and run the conversion
    >>> interface.run_conversion(nwbfile_path=path_to_save_nwbfile, metadata=metadata)


NeuroConv writes as much metadata as is available in the source format, but most of the time the
experimenter has metadata that the records do not carry. Adding the rest improves the provenance of
the file and makes it more useful for future users and for the community as a whole. To add it, follow
:ref:`the pose estimation how-to <annotate_pose_metadata>`, which walks through common experimental
configurations.
