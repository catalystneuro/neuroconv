Developer Guide
===============

There are many ways to contribute to the NeuroConv project! To help ensure a smooth Pull Request (PR) process, please always begin by `raising an issue <https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/issues>`_ on the main repository so we can openly discuss any problems/additions before taking action.

The most common contribution is for a user/developer to help us integrate a new data format and shape it into a general data interface. A guideline on how to build a new data interface and a graphical overview of the object structure can be found here:
