This directory contains two sessions of recorded data using AlphaRS hardware and
AlphaRS software version 1.2
The data are recorded into the *.mpx files and *.lsx files are just plain text
files indexing which file are from which session.

The data only record noise (no probe was connected to the head-stage).
The first sessions contains two seperate recordings where the first one is
split into 2MB maximum size files. The second one contains one recording without
lsx file indexing it.

These were recorded on 2021-11-17 by Thomas Perret <thomas.perret@isc.cnrs.fr>
at ISC-MJ UMR5229 CNRS, Lyon, France.
