'''
Script to generate test data for the nestIO.
Uses conductance-based integrate-and-fire neurons.
Records spikes, voltages and conductances.

based on:

Random balanced network (delta synapses)
----------------------------------------

This script simulates an excitatory and an inhibitory population on
the basis of the network used in

Brunel N, Dynamics of Sparsely Connected Networks of Excitatory and
Inhibitory Spiking Neurons, Journal of Computational Neuroscience 8,
183â€“208 (2000).

When connecting the network customary synapse models are used, which
allow for querying the number of created synapses. Using spike
detectors the average firing rates of the neurons in the populations
are established. The building as well as the simulation time of the
network are recorded.
