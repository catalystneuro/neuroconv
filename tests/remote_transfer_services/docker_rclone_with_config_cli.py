"""
This file is hidden from normal pytest globbing by not including 'test' in the filename.

Instead, the tests must be invoked directly from the file. This is designed mostly for use in the GitHub Actions.

To allow this test to work, the developer must create a folder on the outer level of their personal Google Drive
called 'testing_rclone_with_config' which contains a single subfolder 'ci_tests'
with example text file 'test_text_file.txt' containing the content
"This is a test file for the Rclone (with config) docker image hosted on NeuroConv!".

Then the developer must install Rclone and call `rclone config` to generate tokens in their own `rclone.conf` file.
The developer can easily find the location of the config file on their system using `rclone config file`.
