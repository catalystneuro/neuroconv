"""
Remote Transfer Services tests for NeuroConv.

This package contains tests for external cloud service integrations such as AWS, DANDI, and Globus.
These tests require actual credentials and API keys to communicate with live services.

Note: These tests are not automatically collected by pytest's default collection mechanism
because they don't follow the "test_" naming convention in their filenames.
