# Upcoming

### Back-compatability break
* All built-in DataInterfaces are now nested under the `neuroconv.datainterfaces` import structure - they are no longer available from the outer level. To import a data interface, use the syntax `from neuroconv.datainterfaces import <name of interface>`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `AxonaRecordingExtractorInterface` has been renamed to `AxonaRecordingInterface`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `AxonaUnitRecordingExtractorInterface` has been renamed to `AxonaUnitRecordingInterface`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `BlackrockRecordingExtractorInterface` has been renamed to `BlackrockRecordingInterface`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `BlackrockSortingExtractorInterface` has been renamed to `BlackrockSortingInterface`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `OpenEphysRecordingExtractorInterface` has been renamed to `OpenEphysRecordingInterface`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `OpenEphysSortingExtractorInterface` has been renamed to `OpenEphysSortingInterface`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `KilosortSortingInterface` has been renamed to `KiloSortSortingInterface` to be more consistent with SpikeInterface. [PR #107](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/107)
* The `Neuroscope` interfaces have been renamed to `NeuroScope` to be more consistent with SpikeInterface. [PR #107](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/107)

### Fixes
* Prevented the CEDRecordingInterface from writing non-ecephys channel data. [PR #37](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/37)
* Fixed description in `write_sorting` and in `add_units_table` to have "neuroconv" in the description. [PR #104](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/104)

### Improvements
* Unified the `run_conversion` method of `BaseSegmentationExtractorInterface` with that of all the other base interfaces. The method `write_segmentation` now uses the common `make_or_load_nwbfile` context manager [PR #29](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/29)
* Coerced the recording extractors with `spikeextractors_backend=True` to BaseRecording objects for Axona, Blackrock, Openephys, and SpikeGadgets. [PR #38](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/38)
* Added function to add PlaneSegmentation objects to an nwbfile in `roiextractors` and corresponding unit tests. [PR #23](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/23)
* `use_times` argument to be deprecated on the ecephys pipeline. The function `add_electrical_series` now determines whether the timestamps of the spikeinterface recording extractor are uniform or not and automatically stores the data according to best practices [PR #40](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/40)
* Add `NWBFile` metadata key at the level of the base data interface so it can always be inherited to be available. [PR #51](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/51).
* Added spikeinterface support to Axona LFP and coerece gin tests for LFP to be spikeinterface objects [PR #85](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/85)
* Added function to add fluorescence traces to an nwbfile in `roiextractors` and corresponding unit tests.
  The df over f traces are now added to a `DfOverF` container instead of the `Fluorescence` container.
  The metadata schema has been changed for the `BaseSegmentationExtractorInterface` to allow metadata for `DfOverF`,
  and `Flurorescence` is now not required in the metadata schema. [PR #41](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/41)
* Improved default values of OpticalChannel object names and other descriptions for Imaging data. [PR #88](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/88)
* Extended the `ImagingDataChunkIterator` to be  compatible with volumetric data. [PR #90](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/90)
* Integrated the `ImagingDataChunkIterator` with the `write_imaging` methods. [PR #90](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/90)
* Began work towards making SpikeInterface, SpikeExtractors, and ROIExtractors all non-minimal dependencies. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
