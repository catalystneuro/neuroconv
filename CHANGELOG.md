### Back-compatability break
* All built-in DataInterfaces are now nested under the `neuroconv.datainterfaces` import structure - they are no longer available from the outer level. To import a data interface, use the syntax `from neuroconv.datainterfaces import <name of interface>`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `AxonaRecordingExtractorInterface` has been renamed to `AxonaRecordingInterface`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `AxonaUnitRecordingExtractorInterface` has been renamed to `AxonaUnitRecordingInterface`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `BlackrockRecordingExtractorInterface` has been renamed to `BlackrockRecordingInterface`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `BlackrockSortingExtractorInterface` has been renamed to `BlackrockSortingInterface`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `OpenEphysRecordingExtractorInterface` has been renamed to `OpenEphysRecordingInterface`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `OpenEphysSortingExtractorInterface` has been renamed to `OpenEphysSortingInterface`. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* The `KilosortSortingInterface` has been renamed to `KiloSortSortingInterface` to be more consistent with SpikeInterface. [PR #107](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/107)
* The `Neuroscope` interfaces have been renamed to `NeuroScope` to be more consistent with SpikeInterface. [PR #107](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/107)

* Removed deprecation warnings for `save_path` argument (which is now `nwbfile_path` everywhere in the package). [PR #124](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/124)
* Changed default device name for the ecephys pipeline. Device_ecephys -> DeviceEcephys [PR #154](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/154)

### Improvements
* Unified the `run_conversion` method of `BaseSegmentationExtractorInterface` with that of all the other base interfaces. The method `write_segmentation` now uses the common `make_or_load_nwbfile` context manager [PR #29](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/29)
* Coerced the recording extractors with `spikeextractors_backend=True` to BaseRecording objects for Axona, Blackrock, Openephys, and SpikeGadgets. [PR #38](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/38)

* `use_times` argument to be deprecated on the ecephys pipeline. The function `add_electrical_series` now determines whether the timestamps of the spikeinterface recording extractor are uniform or not and automatically stores the data according to best practices [PR #40](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/40)
* Add `NWBFile` metadata key at the level of the base data interface so it can always be inherited to be available. [PR #51](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/51).
* Added spikeinterface support to Axona LFP and coerece gin tests for LFP to be spikeinterface objects [PR #85](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/85)
* Added function to add fluorescence traces to an nwbfile in `roiextractors` and corresponding unit tests.
  The df over f traces are now added to a `DfOverF` container instead of the `Fluorescence` container.
  The metadata schema has been changed for the `BaseSegmentationExtractorInterface` to allow metadata for `DfOverF`,
  and `Flurorescence` is now not required in the metadata schema. [PR #41](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/41)
* Improved default values of OpticalChannel object names and other descriptions for Imaging data. [PR #88](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/88)
* Extended the `ImagingDataChunkIterator` to be  compatible with volumetric data. [PR #90](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/90)
* Integrated the `ImagingDataChunkIterator` with the `write_imaging` methods. [PR #90](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/90)
* Began work towards making SpikeInterface, SpikeExtractors, and ROIExtractors all non-minimal dependencies. [PR #74](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/74)
* Implemented format-wise and modality-wise extra installation requirements. If there are any requirements to use a module or data interface, these are defined in individual requirements files at the corresponding level of the package. These are in turn easily accessible from the commands `pip install neuroconv[format_name]`. `pip install neuroconv[modality_name]` will also install all dependencies necessary to make full use of any interfaces from that modality. [PR #100](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/100)
* Added frame stubbing to the `BaseSegmentationExtractorInterface`. [PR #116](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/116)
* Added `mask_type: str` and `include_roi_centroids: bool` to the `add_plane_segmentation` helper and `write_segmentation` functions for the `tools.roiextractors` submodule. [PR #117](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/117)
* Propagate `output_struct_name` argument to `ExtractSegmentationInterface` to match its extractor arguments. [PR #128](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/128)
* Added compression and iteration (with options control) to all Fluorescence traces in `write_segmentation`. [PR #120](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/120)
* For irregular recordings, timestamps can now be saved along with all traces in `write_segmentation`. [PR #130](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/130)
* Added `mask_type` argument to `tools.roiextractors.add_plane_segmentation` function and all upstream calls. This allows users to request writing not just the image_masks (still the default) but also pixels, voxels or `None` of the above. [PR #119](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/119)
* `utils.json_schema.get_schema_from_method_signature` now allows `Optional[...]` annotation typing and subsequent `None` values during validation as long as it is still only applied to a simple non-conflicting type (no `Optional[Union[..., ...]]`). [PR #119](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/119)
