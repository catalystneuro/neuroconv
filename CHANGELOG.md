[PR #100](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/100)
* Added frame stubbing to the `BaseSegmentationExtractorInterface`. [PR #116](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/116)
* Added `mask_type: str` and `include_roi_centroids: bool` to the `add_plane_segmentation` helper and `write_segmentation` functions for the `tools.roiextractors` submodule. [PR #117](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/117)
* Propagate `output_struct_name` argument to `ExtractSegmentationInterface` to match its extractor arguments. [PR #128](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/128)
* Added compression and iteration (with options control) to all Fluorescence traces in `write_segmentation`. [PR #120](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/120)
* For irregular recordings, timestamps can now be saved along with all traces in `write_segmentation`. [PR #130](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/130)
* Added `mask_type` argument to `tools.roiextractors.add_plane_segmentation` function and all upstream calls. This allows users to request writing not just the image_masks (still the default) but also pixels, voxels or `None` of the above. [PR #119](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/119)
* `utils.json_schema.get_schema_from_method_signature` now allows `Optional[...]` annotation typing and subsequent `None` values during validation as long as it is still only applied to a simple non-conflicting type (no `Optional[Union[..., ...]]`). [PR #119](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/pull/119)
