    "center_target_appearance_time": "References the Definition for the center target cue behavior. Treated as an event at the timestamp in this column.",
    "lateral_target_appearance_time": "References the Definition for the lateral target stimulus. Treated as an event at the timestamp in this column.",
    "cursor_departure_time": "References the Definition for the monkey's wrist movement. This column represents the real-time detection of the action initiation (cursor leaving start zone).",
    "reward_time": "References the Definition for the reward outcome (juice delivery).",
    "movement_type": "Categorical column defining the direction of movement (flexion vs extension). Requires a separate JSON sidecar to map these string values to specific HED tags (e.g., 'flexion' -> '(Flexion)').",
    "torque_perturbation_type": "Categorical column defining the direction/existence of the perturbation. Requires a separate JSON sidecar to map values to tags.",
    "torque_perturbation_onset_time": "References the Definition for the mechanical torque pulse. Removed invalid 'Mechanical-stimulation'/'Force' tags, replaced with 'Sensory-event', 'Tactile-presentation', and a 'Label'.",
    "derived_movement_onset_time": "Using the Onset tag with the Cursor-movement Definition creates a temporal scope for the movement duration. Marked as Computed-feature to distinguish from the real-time cursor departure detection.",
    "derived_movement_end_time": "Using the Offset tag paired with the onset column closes the temporal scope of the movement event. Marked as Computed-feature.",
    "derived_peak_velocity": "The magnitude of the peak velocity. Removed '/#' placeholder to resolve validation error; the tag 'Speed' characterizes the numeric data in this column.",
    "derived_peak_velocity_time": "An event acting as a data marker for the moment peak velocity occurred. 'Data-maximum' and 'Speed' indicate what reached a peak at this time.",
    "derived_movement_amplitude": "Numeric distance of the movement. Removed '/#' placeholder to resolve validation error; 'Distance' characterizes the data.",
    "derived_end_position": "Final joint position. Removed '/#' placeholder to resolve validation error; 'Angle' characterizes the data."
