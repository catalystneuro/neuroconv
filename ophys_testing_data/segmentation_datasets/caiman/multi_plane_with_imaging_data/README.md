Mini-sample for 1-photon 3-plane miniscope imaging processed with CaImAn CNMFE 

This dataset is from the Fleischmann Lab at Brown University, collected and processed by Olivia Mckissick (olivia[UNDERSCORE]mckissick[AT]brown[DOT]edu) and Camille Donoho (camille[UNDERSCORE]donoho[AT]brown[DOT]edu). 

The purpose of this sample dataset is to test neuroconv / roiextractors packages to perform NWB conversion with 1-photon multiplane miniscope imaging data processed with CaImAn CNMFE. If you use it for other purposes, please contact Olivia Mckissick. 

There are 3 planes in total in this folder, each being a different focus, having 1 corresponding TIFF file and 1 CAIMAN HDF5 file. Note that since these are meant to be sample dataset, the segmentation was not optimized or not quality controlled.
