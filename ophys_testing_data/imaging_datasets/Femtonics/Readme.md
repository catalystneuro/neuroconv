This dataset contains imaging data from the following publication:

Gonzalo Cogno, S., Obenhaus, H. A., Lautrup, A., Jacobsen, R. I., Clopath, C., Andersson, S. O., Donato, F., Moser, M.-B., & Moser, E. I. (2023). Minute-scale oscillatory sequences in medial entorhinal cortex. Nature, 625(7994), 338–344. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06864-1

According to the methods the data was aquired using a custom-built 2-photon benchtop microscope from Femtonics.
The software MESc (v 3.3 and 3.5, Femtonics,Hungary) was used for microscope control and data acquisition. Imaging time series of either 30 min or 60 min were acquired at 512×512 pixels (sampling frequency: 30.95 Hz, frame duration: 32 ms; pixel size: either 1.78 μm x 1.78 μm or 1.18 μm x 1.18 μm)

To reduce its size the data then was stubbed by h.mayorquin@gmail.com  with the following script:
