# Progress

## What Works
- Memory bank initialized with project context
- Clear understanding of task requirements:
  - Add Returns sections to getter function docstrings
  - Use NumPy style
  - Only modify existing docstrings
  - Preserve other content

## Current Status
Implementation complete:
- Examined all getter functions in codebase
- Added Returns sections where missing
- Ensured consistent NumPy style
- Verified changes maintained existing content
- All 77 files and 253 getters have been checked and updated as needed

## Known Issues
None identified

## What's Left to Build
âœ… Task completed:
- All getter functions now have proper Returns sections in NumPy style
- All changes preserved existing content
- All files have been checked and documented in checked_files.md

## Next Actions
1. Start with first getter function
2. Read current docstring
3. Add Returns section if missing
4. Move to next function
5. Track progress through the list
