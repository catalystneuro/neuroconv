# Project Brief

## Overview
NeuroConv is a Python package for converting neurophysiology data to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format. It provides a standardized way to convert various proprietary and open source neurophysiology file formats into NWB files.

## Core Requirements
1. Convert neurophysiology data from various formats to NWB
2. Maintain data integrity during conversion
3. Provide consistent interface across different data types
4. Handle metadata properly
5. Support temporal alignment of data streams
6. Follow best practices for documentation

## Goals
1. Make neurophysiology data more accessible and reusable
2. Reduce friction in data sharing
3. Standardize conversion processes
4. Ensure converted data meets NWB specifications
5. Maintain high code quality and documentation standards

## Current Focus
Improving docstring quality across the codebase, particularly for getter functions to ensure they follow NumPy docstring style and include proper Returns sections.
