# Project Brief: NeuroConv

## Overview
NeuroConv is a Python library for converting neurophysiology data from various proprietary formats into NWB (Neuro Data Without Borders) format. It serves as a standardization tool for the neuroscience community, enabling better data sharing and analysis.

## Core Requirements
1. Convert diverse neurophysiology data formats to NWB
2. Support multiple data types:
   - Electrophysiology (ecephys)
   - Optical physiology (ophys)
   - Behavior
   - Imaging
   - Text/metadata
3. Maintain data integrity during conversion
4. Provide consistent interface across different data sources
5. Enable extensibility for new data formats

## Goals
1. Simplify neurophysiology data conversion workflow
2. Reduce barriers to NWB adoption
3. Promote standardization in neuroscience data
4. Enable efficient data sharing in the neuroscience community
5. Support reproducible research practices

## Success Metrics
1. Successful conversion of various data formats
2. Minimal data loss during conversion
3. Easy integration with existing workflows
4. Comprehensive documentation and examples
5. Active community adoption and contribution

## Scope
- Primary: Data conversion to NWB format
- Secondary: Data validation and quality checks
- Included: Multiple data type support, documentation, testing
- Excluded: Data analysis, visualization tools

## Stakeholders
1. Neuroscience researchers
2. Data scientists
3. Lab technicians
4. Software developers
5. NWB community
