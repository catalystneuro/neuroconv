# Project Brief: NeuroConv

## Overview

NeuroConv is a Python package designed to streamline the conversion of neurophysiology data from various proprietary formats to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard. It serves as a critical bridge in the neuroscience data ecosystem, enabling researchers to standardize their data for better sharing, analysis, and long-term preservation.

## Core Requirements

1. **Format Support**
   - Convert data from 40+ popular neurophysiology data formats to NWB
   - Support for multiple modalities:
     - Electrophysiology (ecephys)
     - Optical physiology (ophys)
     - Intracellular electrophysiology (icephys)
     - Behavioral data
     - Text-based data

2. **Data Handling**
   - Efficient processing of large datasets through piece-wise reading
   - Automatic optimization of file sizes via chunking and compression
   - Support for multiple data streams and temporal alignment
   - Preservation of metadata from source formats

3. **User Experience**
   - Simple, consistent API for all supported formats
   - Clear documentation and conversion examples
   - Flexible configuration options
   - Minimal setup requirements

4. **Code Quality**
   - Type hints and numpy-style docstrings
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Black code formatting
   - Clear changelog maintenance

## Target Users

1. **Neuroscience Researchers**
   - Primary users converting their experimental data to NWB
   - Need efficient handling of large datasets
   - Require preservation of metadata and experimental context

2. **Data Scientists**
   - Working with neurophysiology data from multiple sources
   - Need standardized data format for analysis
   - Require programmatic access to data and metadata

3. **Tool Developers**
   - Building analysis tools that work with NWB data
   - Need reliable conversion from proprietary formats
   - Require consistent data structure and metadata

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**
   - Successful conversion of data with metadata preservation
   - Efficient handling of large datasets
   - Accurate temporal alignment of multiple data streams

2. **Performance**
   - Optimized file sizes through compression
   - Memory-efficient processing of large datasets
   - Reasonable conversion times for typical datasets

3. **Usability**
   - Clear documentation and examples
   - Consistent error messages and validation
   - Intuitive API design

4. **Reliability**
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Stable releases with clear versioning
   - Active maintenance and bug fixes
