# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initial setup and documentation of project context through memory bank initialization.

## Recent Changes
1. Created core memory bank files:
   - projectbrief.md: Defined project scope and goals
   - productContext.md: Documented problem space and solutions
   - systemPatterns.md: Outlined architecture and patterns
   - techContext.md: Detailed technical stack and constraints
   - activeContext.md (this file): Tracking current state
   - progress.md (pending): Will track project progress

## Active Decisions
1. Memory Bank Structure
   - Organized with clear hierarchy
   - Core files established
   - Ready for future updates

2. Documentation Approach
   - Comprehensive coverage of project aspects
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Maintainable structure

## Current Considerations
1. Project Understanding
   - Complex neurophysiology data conversion system
   - Multiple data type support
   - Emphasis on data integrity and validation

2. Documentation Needs
   - Keep memory bank updated with changes
   - Track progress and decisions
   - Maintain clear context

3. Next Steps
   - Complete progress.md
   - Monitor project evolution
   - Update documentation as needed

## Open Questions
1. Additional context files needed?
2. Specific areas requiring deeper documentation?
3. Integration with existing documentation?

## Current State
1. Memory Bank
   - Core structure established
   - Initial content created
   - Ready for ongoing updates

2. Project Status
   - Active development
   - Multiple data interfaces
   - Comprehensive testing suite

## Immediate Tasks
1. Create progress.md
2. Review documentation completeness
3. Prepare for future updates

## Notes
- Memory bank will evolve with project
- Regular updates needed
- Focus on maintaining clear context
