* When developing a new feature or fixing a bug, always write corresponding tests and run the tests to ensure the feature worked
* When adding tests, first read through the existing tests and try to fit new tests in the existing testing infrastructure
* If a new feature requires a new dependency, make sure to add it in the pyproject.toml
* To enable dependencies that are specific to certain Interface or Converter classes, import these additional dependencies within the class using `tools.get_package` instead of importing them at the top of the file.
* Always make a contribution to the CHANGELOG file summarizing any changes
* Use typehints and numpy-style docstrings
* always apply Black formatting
* avoid making any modifications that are not strictly necessary to the task you've been requested to do (including docstrings)
* if you spot any possible errors or have suggestions for improvement outside of the scope of your requested task, you can add them to your Task Completed message
