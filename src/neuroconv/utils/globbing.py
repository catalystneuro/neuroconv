def decompose_f_string(f_string: str) -> (List[str], List[str]):
    """
    Decompose an f-string into the list of variable names and the separators between them.

    An f-string is any string that contains enclosed curly brackets around text.
    A variable is defined as the text expression within the enclosed curly brackets.
    The separators are the strings remnants that surround the variables.

    An example f-string and components would be: 'This is {an} f-string!', with variable 'an' and separators
    'This is ' and ' f-string!'.
    An instance of this example would be: 'This is definitely a good f-string!' with variable value 'definitely a good'.

    Example
    -------
        variable_names, separators = decompose_f_string(f_string="a/{x}b{y}/c{z}")
        # variable_names = ["x", "y", "z"]
        # separators = ["a/", "b", "/c"", ""]

    #     |
    #     }.*?   after a closure

def parse_f_string(string: str, f_string: str):
    """
    Given an instance of an f-string rule, extract the values of the variables specified by the f-string.

    Recovery of values is only possible in cases where the string instance is uniquely invertible,
    which requires at a minimum requires...
        1) Separators between all curly bracket enclosures, *e.g.*, '{var1}{var2}' is not allowed.
           An easy way to resolve this is to add a unique separator between them, *i.e.*, '{var1}-{var2}'.
        2) The separator character(s) cannot also occur within the variable values, *e.g.*, '{var1}b{var2}' on
           instance 'sub_01bsess_040122' where var1='sub_01 and' and var2='sess_040122'. Since the separator is a single
           character 'b' which also occurs in the instance of var1, it cannot be determined which occurrence is the
           proper separator.

           Resolving this relies on choosing unique separators between variables in the f-string rule; either a single
           character that you know will never occur in any of your instances, or preferably a sequence of characters
           that would not occur together. In the example above, a simple separator of '-' would suffice, but if other
           instances might include that, such as var1='sub-05', then a sequential separator of '--' would work instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    string : str
        An instance of the f-string rule.
    fstring : str
        String containing non-empty substrings enclosed by "{" and "}".
        These correspond to the names of variables thought to encode the actual filename string.
