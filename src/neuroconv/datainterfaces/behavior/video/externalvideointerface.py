        Initialize the interface.

        This interface handles multiple video segments and writes them as an ImageSeries with a link to external_file.
        For writing videos internally with just an ImageSeries object, use the InternalVideoInterface.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_paths : list of FilePaths
            Many video storage formats segment a sequence of videos over the course of the experiment.
            Pass the file paths for this videos as a list in sorted, consecutive order.
        verbose : bool, optional
            If True, display verbose output. Defaults to False.
        video_name : str, optional
            The name of this video as it will appear in the ImageSeries.
            Defaults to "ExternalVideo".

            This key is essential when multiple video streams are present in a single experiment.
            The associated metadata should be a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary
            containing metadata for a single video stream comprised of potentially multiple segments:

            ```

                ...
            }
            ```

            Where each entry corresponds to a separate VideoInterface and ImageSeries. Note, that
