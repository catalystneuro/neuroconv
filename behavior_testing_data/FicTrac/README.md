## Files provided by the project
The directory named `samples` contains the data provided by the FicTrac project in their own [github repo](https://github.com/rjdmoore/fictrac) on 2023-07-24.

The original data is located here:
https://github.com/rjdmoore/fictrac/tree/master/sample

The original data contains only the configuration file and the sample video (`sample.mp4`).

The actual FicTrac data which consists on the infered trajectories (the `.dat` file) and the rest of the files (log and configuration images) are generated after running the software in question. Those were generated by h.mayorquin@gmail.com by running the sample files as they are following the instructions given in the FicTrac repo.
